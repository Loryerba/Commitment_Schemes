# Commitment_Schemes
***
## Intro
This is a Python library which provides some VC schemes like:
- Catalano & Fiore VC based on RSA assumption => https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/495.pdf
- Catalano & Fiore VC based on CDH assumption => https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/495.pdf
- Pointproofs base on CDH assumption          => https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/419.pdf
- KVaC: Key-Value Commitments for Blockchains and Beyond => https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1161.pdf

## Goal
The goal of this library is to provide an open source repository for those who want to develop and test old and new VC schemes. I'm not aiming to develop fast and clean code which provides short time during execution,
but to program schemes to verify their performance.

## Dependencies
Here there is a list of dependencies needed:
+ [Charm 0.5.0](https://github.com/JHUISI/charm)
+ [PyCryptoDome](https://www.pycryptodome.org/)
+ [Python 3.9 or less for building Charm](https://github.com/deadsnakes)
